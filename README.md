## Introduction

Introducing the `@lephenix47/speech-to-text-utility` library, a powerful and flexible solution designed for JavaScript and TypeScript developers looking to integrate speech recognition features into their projects. Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, this library harnesses the power of the browser's Web Speech API to transcribe real-time audio inputs with ease.

## Usage

### Importing the Library

To begin, you'll need to import the library into your project:

```js
  import { SpeechToText } from '@lephenix47/speech-to-text-utility';
```

### Configuring and Starting Speech Recognition

From here, you can personalize the speech recognition behavior to fit your application's demands. Some notable methods worth mentioning include setting the language, enabling interim results, limiting the number of alternatives, toggling continual recognition, and configuring event callbacks.

Example:

```js
  const speechToText = new SpeechToText();

  speechToText
    .setLanguage('en-US')
    .setInterimResults(true)
    .setMaxAlternatives(5)
    .setContinuous(true)
    .setOnResult((sentence, isFinal) => {
      if (isFinal) {
        console.log(`Received Final Result: "${sentence}"`);
      } else {
        console.log(`Received Intermediate Result: "${sentence}"`);
      }
    });
```

Ready to embark on recognizing speech? Trigger the speech recognition engine with the startRecognition() method.

```js
  speechToText.startRecognition();
```

Should you ever decide to halt the recognition midway, rely on the handy stopRecognition() method.

```js
  speechToText.stopRecognition();
```
